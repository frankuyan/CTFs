## Solution


As a Dune enthuaist, who has seen both films half a dozen times, I know that the finest doctor on Caladan is Dr. Yueh. However, the ctf server did not accept the flag ```UTCTF{Wellington_Yueh
}```. Nonetheless, we were provided with a .jpg file of a certain google street view (360 degress full panoramic view)

From here, we are given an image of a Google StreetView of a supposedly medical center. 

Lets try to find cues to identify macro details of the location i.e. country, administrative division such as provinces, states, cities, etc.

With the glarring white on red stop octogon being the 'Stop Sign' , we can tell that is based in North America, specifcally in an English speaking territory. Québec, being the uniquely French speaking province in Canada, we can rule out the possibility of it being in Québec.


Now lets look for some other identifyers. 

The newstand by the entrance of the building could provide some insight. Only the "amp" is visble in this newspaper or megazine dispenser.
